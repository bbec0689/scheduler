# Work Day Scheduler


## What I did

* First I went and changed the folders and directories to set it up in a proper and easy format.

* The I went into the HTML and created the time blocks using bootstrap.

* Then I copy and pasted it until I got the right amount of hours.

* Then I went and changed the time blocks to match the hour of the day they were supposed to be.

* After that I went to CSS and changed the background color of the jumbotron and body to give it a little more style.

* Then I formatted the script.js using moment.js and created the date format at the top of the page.

* After I did that I created the code to store everything in local storage.

* Then I created a time keeper that added the past present and future classes and programmed it to add or remove the classes based upon what the current time was.

* Finally I added the getItem code that returns the local storage to the page.
